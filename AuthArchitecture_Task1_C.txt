Task C: Structured Logging Implementation
Note to Cline: Ignore the instructions "for User". Those are my tasks, only the parts for "Cline" should be touched by you!
=========================================

What We Want to Do
-----------------
We need to implement a comprehensive structured logging system that provides clear visibility into our authentication and session management processes. This system should capture meaningful events, errors, and performance metrics while maintaining proper security and privacy standards.

Why We Want to Do It
-------------------
Proper logging is essential for monitoring system health, diagnosing issues, and maintaining security compliance. Our current implementation lacks the structured logging necessary for effective monitoring and troubleshooting. By implementing structured logging, we can better understand system behavior, identify potential security issues, and maintain audit trails for authentication events.

How We Want to Do It
-------------------

### Part 1: Log Structure

Required Implementation (For Cline):
```typescript
interface AuthLogEvent {
  eventId: string;        // Unique identifier for the event
  timestamp: number;      // Unix timestamp
  level: LogLevel;        // Error, warn, info, debug
  category: LogCategory;  // Auth, Session, Token, etc.
  userId?: string;        // Associated user if available
  sessionId?: string;     // Associated session if available
  message: string;        // Human-readable description
  data: Record<string, unknown>; // Additional context
  environment: string;    // Production/development
}

enum LogLevel {
  ERROR = 'error',
  WARN = 'warn',
  INFO = 'info',
  DEBUG = 'debug'
}

enum LogCategory {
  AUTH = 'auth',
  SESSION = 'session',
  TOKEN = 'token',
  RATE_LIMIT = 'rate_limit',
  CSRF = 'csrf'
}
```

These interfaces must be implemented exactly as shown because:
- They define our standard logging format
- They enable consistent event tracking
- They maintain proper privacy boundaries
- They support our monitoring requirements
- Other components will rely on this structure

### Part 2: Logging Service

Required Implementation (For Cline):
```typescript
interface LoggingService {
  logAuthEvent(event: Omit<AuthLogEvent, 'eventId' | 'timestamp'>): Promise<void>;
  
  logError(
    category: LogCategory,
    error: Error,
    context?: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<void>;
  
  getRecentEvents(
    filter: {
      level?: LogLevel;
      category?: LogCategory;
      userId?: string;
      sessionId?: string;
    },
    limit: number
  ): Promise<AuthLogEvent[]>;
}
```

This interface must be implemented exactly as shown because:
- It provides standardized logging methods
- It enables proper error tracking
- It supports security auditing requirements
- It maintains consistency across the system

Implementation Guidance for Cline:
1. Review our current logging implementation
2. Check existing error handling patterns
3. Implement the logging service with proper sanitization
4. Ensure sensitive data is properly handled

Instructions for Cline
---------------------

1. Create Logging Implementation:
- Implement the specified interfaces
- Add proper data sanitization
- Ensure asynchronous logging doesn't impact performance
- Add log rotation and retention logic
- Implement environment-specific logging levels

2. Required Test Coverage:
```typescript
describe('Structured Logging', () => {
  it('should properly format log events');
  it('should sanitize sensitive data');
  it('should handle asynchronous logging');
  it('should respect environment log levels');
  it('should maintain proper error context');
});
```

Success Criteria
---------------

For Cline:
- All specified interfaces implemented exactly
- Logging working correctly in all environments
- Test coverage complete and passing
- Proper data sanitization implemented
- Performance impact minimized

For User:
- Clear visibility into authentication events
- Proper error tracking
- Effective troubleshooting capability
- Privacy requirements maintained
