Task 5: SignalR Integration with Token Authentication
=================================================

What We Want to Do
-----------------
We need to implement secure SignalR authentication that integrates with our token system while efficiently handling real-time connections across multiple tabs. This system must authenticate connections quickly, manage reconnection attempts securely, and coordinate connection state across browser tabs.

Why We Want to Do It
-------------------
Our real-time features require secure and efficient SignalR connections. The current implementation needs enhancement to support our new token system and multi-tab functionality. By implementing proper SignalR authentication, we can ensure secure real-time communication while maintaining optimal connection management.

This enhancement addresses several critical needs. First, it reduces our connection costs by sharing a single SignalR connection across multiple tabs. Second, it ensures secure authentication for all real-time communications. Third, it provides reliable connection state management, preventing issues like duplicate messages or missed updates.

How We Want to Do It
-------------------

### Part 1: Connection Management

Required Implementation (For Cline):
```typescript
interface SignalRConnection {
  // Core connection configuration
  connectionId: string;
  activeHubs: string[];
  lastConnected: number;
  reconnectAttempts: number;
  
  // Connection state
  status: ConnectionStatus;
  error?: string;
  
  // Tab management
  primaryTabId: string;
  subscribedTabs: string[];
}

enum ConnectionStatus {
  CONNECTING = 'connecting',
  CONNECTED = 'connected',
  RECONNECTING = 'reconnecting',
  DISCONNECTED = 'disconnected'
}
```

These interfaces must be implemented exactly as shown because:
- They define the essential state needed for connection management
- They support our multi-tab coordination requirements
- They enable proper error handling and recovery
- Other components depend on these specific states

### Part 2: Authentication Flow

Required Implementation (For Cline):
```typescript
interface SignalRAuthenticator {
  // Get valid token for connection
  getConnectionToken(): Promise<string>;
  
  // Handle token refresh during connection
  handleTokenRefresh(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Manage connection state
  updateConnectionState(status: ConnectionStatus): Promise<void>;
  
  // Handle connection errors
  handleAuthenticationError(error: Error): Promise<void>;
}
```

This interface must be implemented exactly as shown because:
- It provides consistent authentication handling
- It supports automatic token refresh
- It enables proper error recovery
- It maintains security during reconnection attempts

Instructions for Cline
---------------------

1. Implement Connection Management:
- Create connection state handling
- Implement multi-tab coordination
- Add proper error handling
- Write comprehensive tests

2. Implement Authentication Flow:
- Use specified SignalRAuthenticator interface
- Integrate with token service
- Implement reconnection logic
- Add monitoring and logging

3. Required Test Coverage:
```typescript
describe('SignalR Integration', () => {
  it('should authenticate connections with valid tokens');
  it('should handle token refresh during active connections');
  it('should coordinate connections across tabs');
  it('should manage reconnection attempts properly');
  it('should handle authentication failures gracefully');
});
```

Implementation Guidance for Cline:
1. Review existing SignalR implementation
2. Integrate with new token system
3. Implement shared worker communication
4. Add comprehensive error handling

Instructions for User (Not for Cline)
-----------------------------------

1. Connection Testing:
- Verify secure connection establishment
- Test reconnection behavior
- Check authentication flow
- Monitor connection stability

2. Performance Testing:
- Test with multiple simultaneous tabs
- Verify message delivery reliability
- Monitor connection overhead
- Check resource usage

3. Security Testing:
- Verify token validation
- Test connection hijacking prevention
- Check secure reconnection
- Verify proper cleanup

Success Criteria
---------------

For Cline:
- All specified interfaces implemented exactly
- Authentication flow working correctly
- Test coverage complete and passing
- Error handling implemented properly
- Logging and monitoring configured

For User:
- Connections establish securely
- Multi-tab coordination working
- Performance remains stable
- Security measures verified
