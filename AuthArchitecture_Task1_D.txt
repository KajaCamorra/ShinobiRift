Task D: Repository Pattern Implementation
Note to Cline: Ignore the instructions "for User". Those are my tasks, only the parts for "Cline" should be touched by you!
======================================

What We Want to Do
-----------------
We need to implement the repository pattern to provide a clean separation between our data access logic and business logic, particularly focusing on our authentication and session management components. This architectural improvement will make our system more maintainable and testable.

Why We Want to Do It
-------------------
Our current implementation mixes data access with business logic, making it harder to test and maintain. By implementing the repository pattern, we'll create a clear separation of concerns, enable better unit testing, and make our code more maintainable. This is particularly important as we proceed with implementing our remaining core authentication and session management features.

How We Want to Do It
-------------------

### Part 1: Repository Interfaces

Required Implementation (For Cline):
```typescript
interface IRepository<T> {
  getById(id: string): Promise<T | null>;
  create(entity: T): Promise<void>;
  update(id: string, entity: Partial<T>): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}

interface ISessionRepository extends IRepository<SessionData> {
  getByUserId(userId: string): Promise<SessionData[]>;
  getActiveSessionCount(): Promise<number>;
  cleanup(olderThan: number): Promise<void>;
}

interface IAuthenticationRepository extends IRepository<AuthenticationRecord> {
  getByProvider(provider: AuthSource): Promise<AuthenticationRecord[]>;
  getByExternalId(provider: AuthSource, externalId: string): Promise<AuthenticationRecord | null>;
}
```

These interfaces must be implemented exactly as shown because:
- They define our standard repository operations
- They ensure consistent data access patterns
- They enable proper dependency injection
- Other components will rely on these interfaces
- They support our testing requirements

Implementation Guidance for Cline:
1. Review our current data access patterns
2. Examine existing session and authentication storage
3. Plan implementation to minimize disruption to existing code
4. Consider how to handle existing Redis operations

Instructions for Cline
---------------------

1. Create Base Implementations:
- Implement the core repository interfaces
- Create concrete implementations for session management
- Add proper error handling
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add transaction support where needed

2. Required Test Coverage:
```typescript
describe('Repository Pattern', () => {
  it('should handle basic CRUD operations');
  it('should maintain data consistency');
  it('should handle concurrent operations');
  it('should integrate with existing Redis usage');
  it('should respect transaction boundaries');
});
```

Success Criteria
---------------

For Cline:
- All specified interfaces implemented exactly
- Existing functionality preserved
- Test coverage complete and passing
- Error handling implemented
- Proper integration with logging system

For User:
- No disruption to existing functionality
- Improved code organization
- Better testability
- Maintained performance
